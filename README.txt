Issue 3 by David Hernandez
The class UserController was split into two classes, UserController and LoginSignUpController. 
The methods login2 and signUp were moved from UserController and moved to LoginSignUpController.
This change was made in order to reduce the size of UserController to make the class easier to understand.
